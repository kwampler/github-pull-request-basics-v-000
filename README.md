git c# GitHub Pull Request Basics

## Problem Statement

The concept of a pull request is unique to GitHub &mdash; so don't feel nervous
about not knowing what it is! "Pull requests" power the communities of developers
who create and contribute to "open sourced" projects on GitHub.

Through this process, **anyone** can

1. _fork_ a repo from its original organization
2. _clone_ it to a local machine
3. Make changes in a feature _branch_ on their local system
4. _push_ their branch to their _forked_ repo

...and now the critical step....

5. Suggest that the original organization _pull_ the changes that make up the
   feature branch _back to the original repository_.

Instead of the owner working on their codebase alone, _anyone_ can contribute
tests, documentation fixes, new features, layout, graphics, etc. How does this
feature work? It's an awesome feeling when you wake up and see that someone
you've never met has made an improvement to your code that they'd like to
contribute!

## Explain What a Pull Requests Is

A pull request is a request to the owner of another repo to take changes you
made in a branch on your _fork_ of their repo and integrate it into theirs _as
if_ you had done the work _on theirs directly_. It is a request for the owner
of a repository to accept your changes, that you made on your own copy of the
repo ("your fork"), and "pull" them into the owner's repository. [Here][pr] is
a great example of a pull request on the `Ruby` codebase.

> **NOTE** 
> The term “pull requests” comes from the distributed nature of how many open
> source projects organize themselves. Instead of pushing your changes into a
> central repository, you are publishing your changes separately and asking the
> maintainer to pull in your changes. The maintainer then can look over the changes
> and do said pull. This is not the same as by `git pull`, which will integrate
> changes made in a remote repo to the your local version of the branch.

## Identify How to Create a Pull Request from a Fork to a Repo

Let's go over a conceptual, hypothetical example. It's okay if this feels a bit
confusing at first. You'll work through this countless times and eventually
your brain and fingers will both grasp what's going on. Let's look at the
following example:


1. Let's pretend that the `learn-co-students` organization has a repo called
   awesome-lab, and we make a "fork" from this repo at
   `https://github.com/learn-co-students/awesome-lab`.
2. You would now have a _copy_ of that repo on your GitHub account ("organization") i.e.
   `https://github.com/your-user-name/awesome-lab`. Technologists would say
   you "forked" the `awesome-lab` repo from the `learn-co-students` organization
   to the `your-user-name` organization.
3. However, you still would not have a *local* copy of this repository on your computer.
4. You would clone from **your** fork to your computer. There's no reason you _couldn't_
   clone from the _original_ repo. However, most repo owners don't want random
   people on the internet (like you!) committing to their repo. What you're
   going to do is establish a "parallel" repo in _your_ org and then tell the
   "source" repo "Hey, I added something awesome, I'm requesting that you _pull_
   it in."
5. Make some changes on your local machine in a branch
6. Push your code branch from your local system _back_ to _your_ fork
7. Create a `pull request` that requests your improved code be "pulled" into the
   source repo. Observe the steps for initiating a `pull request` below:

#### Step 1

#### Step 2

Here you can choose the base fork, which will be `their-user-name/awesome-lab`.
Then choose the head fork, which will be `your-user-name/awesome-lab`

Now click Create pull request, and you're all set!

What if another student now forks the repository
`https://github.com/learn-co-students/awesome-lab`
as `https://github.com/their-user-name/awesome-lab`, then you make some changes and you
want to send a pull request to their fork `https://github.com/their-user-name/awesome-lab`?
How do you do this?

Luckily, `git` doesn't care whether one repository is the "source" or is
"another fork of the source." If GitHub magically vanished tomorrow, local copies on
hundreds of laptops 'round the world are _just as good as the copy that GitHub_ had!
This is why `git` is called a "Distributed Version Control System." So, to share a
pull request with another student follows the same process as forking some famous
project (like Ruby or jQuery).

## Identify How to Add Commits to an Existing Pull Request

Let's say you make a pull request from
`https://github.com/your-user-name/awesome-lab` to
`https://github.com/learn-co-students/awesome-lab`. Then you notice you made a
typo in your code. All you have to do is fix the typo, commit it and push up
the changes to your branch. As long as the pull request already exists, the
commits will be added automatically.

## Conclusion

Pull requests are merely a tool that allows project owners and project editors to
collaborate without granting too much direct access, or potentially stepping on
each others' toes. This action can be performed even on a repo you are a collaborator
on, but may not have write access to &mdash; but we won't get into that just yet. You'll
continue to learn more about collaboration and how git enables you to track and
edit projects to your heart's content!
